In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the location object's state property directly within a component using `useLocation()` might lead to unexpected behavior if the state is not immediately available.  This is because the state is asynchronously populated and might not be fully available when the component initially renders.  This can result in undefined state values or errors, particularly if you're trying to use it in conditional rendering or within useEffect hooks that execute only once during mounting.
